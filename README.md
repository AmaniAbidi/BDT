This is a video link to the project demo : https://screenrec.com/share/C4cZOubYDz

command used to run the demo: ncat -l 9999

Please, find in demo folder, the screenshots about running the project: opening communication, then typing input data

In the zip, please find kafka-twitter part, that I tried to work on but I faced many challenges, I only succeed to do a simple consumer-producer communication, for twitter, maybe not all developer rights were granted to me.
